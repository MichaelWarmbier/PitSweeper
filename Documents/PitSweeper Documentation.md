**IF THIS LABEL IS PRESENT, THIS DOCUMENT IS CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS!**

&emsp;&emsp;PitSweeper, a game released by an seemingly now-defunct _Kinsman Games_, was released in April of 2009 on various websites, including _Kongregate_ and _Newgrounds_. It was developed on _Adobe Flash_ by Sean Givan, and served as a unique interpretation of _Microsoft_'s _Minesweeper_, combining its unique puzzle mechanics with typical ones discovered in the dungeon crawler genre.

This document serves as a collection of information about the design, implementation and known history of _PitSweeper_.

## History

&emsp;&emsp;Not much is confirmed about the development of _PitSweeper_. From what can be found, PitSweeper was an original game developed sometime prior to its release in April of 2009. Following its release and apparent then-popularity, a sequel was developed as mentioned on the [official website of Kinsman Games](https://kinsmangames.wordpress.com/). Unfortunately, below is the only known image of this sequel.

<p align="center"><img src="https://kinsmangames.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/pitsweeper2.png?w=300&h=225"></p>

_PitSweeper_ received a relevantly significant amount of attention initially, gaining thousands of impressions on both _Newgrounds_ and _Kongregate_, and seeings its game released on similar Flash game hosting platforms. Though, whether these releases were sanctioned or not, is unclear.

## Gameplay (STUB)

&emsp;&emsp;The gameplay of _PitSweeper_ consists of revealing hidden spaces, while also exploring the then-charted territory in search of **treasures** and **weapons** to deal with the various monsters the player, referred to as **Sweeper**, will encounter throughout the game. The final goal is to defeat the Tyrant, located on the ninth level.

## Beastiary

&emsp;&emsp;The **beastiary** (referred to as such internally) is a the collection of enemies present throughout the game that the player may encounter. Each of them has different specifics and statistics associated with them:

###### **Note**: The missing symbol for the "Invisible Stalker" is intentional as per this enemies intended mechanic.
<br>

Each enemy is represented via text as a character. The specific character that represents them is their initial, with the capitalization of said initial reflecting their significance as a foe. Additionally, each enemy is given a **dice number** and **dicetype**. These values are utilized to calculate their high hit through the following formula:

> <p style="font-size: 23px" align="center">Strength + DiceNumber â€¢ DiceType = HighestHit </p>

This method of determining damage is used to convey a sense of randomness. The **dice type** represents how high of a number may be rolled, while the **dice number** is how many times a roll occurs, per attack. The final result is then added to the strength value to be considered as the effective damage for a turn. The difference of that value and the targets **defense** is then utilized to produce a the final result, making the formula:

> <p style="font-size: 23px" align="center"> (RolledDamage + Strength) - PlayerArmor = FinalDamage </p>

Here, you can see the function as it is defined, translated from ActionScript to C++, with the irrelevant portions removed:

```cpp
bool tryToHit(TileBoard w, int targetX, int targetY, Thing target) {
  auto chanceOfMiss, damage, armorCalc;

  chanceOfMiss = meleeChanceOfMiss(this, target);
  
  /* Attack Misses by Chance */
  if (floor(rand() % 100) < chanceOfMiss)  // play miss animation

  /* Attack Hits by Chance */
  else {
    damage = getAnimateDamage() - target.armor;
    if (damage < 0) armorCalc = 0;
    target.hp -= damage;

    if (target.hp <= 0) // play death animation
    sideEffect(); 
  }
return true;
}

/* Note: Method never actually returns false. Meaning, a tryToHit() is always successful, regardless of whether or not the attack misses */
```
###### Code presented is written in C++. Original code is ActionScript.

Within this formula, the method `getAnimateDamage()` is used to return the `(RolledDamage + Strength)` factor. It is defined as such:

```cpp
int getAnimateDamage() {
  int totalDamage = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < this.dicenumber; i++) 
    totalDamage += rand() % dicetype + 1;

  return totalDamage + this.str;
}
```
###### Code presented is written in C++. Original code is ActionScript.

Wherein the previously mentioned randomness mechanic is defined. Additionally, the method `meleeChanceOfMiss()` is also utilized, leading into another relevant mechanic, **miss chance**.

Miss chance may be seen as the following function:

> <p style="font-size: 23px" align="center"> IF: EnemyAgility > PlayerAgility THEN: Chance = 0%<br>ELSE: Chance = 10 - (EnemyAgility - PlayerAgility) * 10<br>IF: Chance > 50% THEN: Chance = 50% </p>

Likewise, defined as C++ code:

```cpp
void meleeChanceOfMiss(Thing, Thing) {
  auto var;

  if (Thing[0].agility > Thing[1].agility) var = 0;
  else var = 10 + (Thing[1].agility - Thing[0].Agility) * 10;
  
  if (var > 50) var = 50;
  return var;
}
```
