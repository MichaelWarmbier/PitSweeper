**IF THIS LABEL IS PRESENT, THIS DOCUMENT IS CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS!**

&emsp;&emsp;PitSweeper, a game released by an seemingly now-defunct _Kinsman Games_, was released in April of 2009 on various websites, including _Kongregate_ and _Newgrounds_. It was developed on _Adobe Flash_ by Sean Givan, and served as a unique interpretation of _Microsoft_'s _Minesweeper_, combining its unique puzzle mechanics with typical ones discovered in the dungeon crawler genre.

This document serves as a collection of information about the design, implementation and known history of _PitSweeper_.

## History

&emsp;&emsp;Not much is confirmed about the development of _PitSweeper_. From what can be found, PitSweeper was an original game developed sometime prior to its release in April 2009. Following its release and apparent then-popularity, a sequel was developed, as mentioned on the [official website of Kinsman Games](https://kinsmangames.wordpress.com/). Unfortunately, below is the only known image of this sequel.

<p align="center"><img src="https://kinsmangames.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/pitsweeper2.png?w=300&h=225"></p>

_PitSweeper_ received a relevantly significant amount of attention initially, gaining thousands of impressions on both _Newgrounds_ and _Kongregate_, and seeing itself released on similar Flash game hosting platforms. Though, whether these releases were sanctioned or not, is unclear.

## Gameplay

&emsp;&emsp;The gameplay of _PitSweeper_ consists of revealing hidden spaces, while also exploring the then-charted territory in search of **treasures** and **weapons** to deal with the various monsters the player, referred to as **Sweeper**, will encounter throughout the game. The final goal is to defeat the Tyrant, located on the ninth level. The game relies on a turn-based system, with each action occurring allowing the game to advance.

The player is given four slots, two of which are for available **weapons** and two of which are for collectable **treasures**. The first weapon slot is reserved for melee weapons, while the second is for ranged. Each time an item is equipped or used, a turn is passed. 

Additionally, the player is able to move in any adjacent direction that is not being hidden by a **cap** (an unrevealed tile). Revealing these caps will also pass a turn, as well as reveal **numbers** which indicate nearby danger:
<br><br>
**Green Numbers**: a treasure or wall is nearby.<br>
**Yellow Numbers**: a mix of treasures, walls and enemies are nearby.<br>
**Red Numbers**: at least one enemy is nearby.<br>
<br>
These numbers act as hints to help the player navigate. The higher the number, the more elements are nearby, capping at a value of eight.

The primary goal of the player is to defeat the **Tyrant** on the final stage of the game. To do this, they are expected to collect items while defeating enemies and collecting **gold** in order to gain **experience**.

Experience allows the player to gain **level**, which then increases their **maximum hp** by three per level. Each enemy provides a single experience, and each level increases the total experience required for another by one. Additionally, reaching a thousand gold will also increase the player's level by one.

## Level Generation 

&emsp;&emsp;Level generation relies on a combination of predesigned level map matrices and a bit of randomness. The randomness allows for different sets of walls to be placed, each set denoted by their own value. You can find each specific map's data matrix in the [Internal Data](#internal-data) section.

The method responsible for creating the board and each element on it is pretty straight forward. After using the predesigned level map as a reference for wall placement, the treasures, items (by their rarity), zombies and enemies are placed randomly throughout the board, increasing in their odds based on how many elements are already near their location. Before this, however, an exit, the player and a gold hoard are _always_ spawned. If the level is the final one, level nine, then a Tyrant is also guaranteed to spawn.

The code below is a translation of the responsible method into C++, along with comments:

```cpp
void randomLevel(TileBoard board, int levelNum) {
    Bitmap levelMap = null;
    int leveData[];
    int randomSelection[], wallTileValue;

    this.levelno = levelNum;

    goodcount = 0;
    badcount = 0;

    /* Use level number to retrieve bitmap */
    levelMap = new Bitmap(new bgarrays[param - 1](320, 320));
    board.backLayer.addChild(levelMap);

    /* Store random preset level arrays */
    levelData = levelArrays[Math.floor(Math.random() * levelarrays.length)];

    randomSelection = [1, 2, 4, 8. 16, 32, 64, 128];
    wallTileValue = randomSelection[Math.floor(Math.random * 8)];

    // Determine Wall Tiles (bitwise operation)
    for(int i = 0; i < levelData; i++) 
        if (Number(levelData[i]) & wallTileValue) { 
            Wall * newWall = new Wall();
            board.addThingAtIndex(newWall, i);

Additionally, below is the method responsible for spawning everything else. Enemies are considered under `addEnemy()`, while everything else is under `addTreasure()`:

```cpp
void addSomethint(int tileX, tileY) {
    badSituation = 0;
    goodSituation = 0;

    /* IF: situation is incredibly unfortunate */
    if (badcount > goodcount + 3) badSituation = 5;

    /* IF: situation is incredibly fortunate */
    if (goodcount > badcount + 3) goodSituation = 5;

    /* Roll 50% good and bad until situation leans to either side */
    while (badSituation < 5 && goodSituation < 5) {
        if (Math.random() <= .5) badSituation++;
        else goodSituation++;
    }
    
    /* IF: situation is just swell, spawn an enemy */
    if (goodSituation > badSituation) {
        addEnemy(tileX, tileY);
        badcount++;
    }

    /* IF: situation sucks, spawn treasure */
    if (badSituation > goodSituation) {
        addTreasure(tileX, tileY);
        goodcount++;
    }
}
```

Because of this fairly complex level generation, a large amount of variety is offered. It is unlikely that the player will ever encounter the same circumstances. In terms of room variants, without including the items and enemies placed later, there are a total of **82** different types of levels a player may encounter.

## Bestiary

&emsp;&emsp;The **bestiary** (referred to as such internally) is a the collection of enemies present throughout the game that the player may encounter. Each of them has different specifics and statistics associated with them:

###### **Note**: The missing symbol for the "Invisible Stalker" is intentional, as per this enemies intended mechanic.
<br>

Each enemy is represented via text as a character. The specific character that represents them is their initial, with the capitalization of said initial reflecting their significance as a foe. Additionally, each enemy is given a **dice number** and **dicetype**. These values are utilized to calculate their high hit through the following formula:

> <p style="font-size: 23px" align="center">Strength + DiceNumber • DiceType = HighestHit </p>

This method of determining damage is used to convey a sense of randomness. The **dice type** represents how high of a number may be rolled, while the **dice number** is how many times a roll occurs, per attack. The final result is then added to the strength value to be considered as the effective damage for a turn. The difference of that value and the target's **defense** is then utilized to produce the final result, making the formula:

> <p style="font-size: 23px" align="center"> (RolledDamage + Strength) - PlayerArmor = FinalDamage </p>

Here, you can see the function as it is defined, translated from ActionScript to C++, with the irrelevant portions removed:

```cpp
bool tryToHit(TileBoard w, int targetX, int targetY, Thing target) {
  auto chanceOfMiss, damage, armorCalc;

  chanceOfMiss = meleeChanceOfMiss(this, target);
  
  /* Attack Misses by Chance */
  if (floor(rand() % 100) < chanceOfMiss)  // play miss animation

  /* Attack Hits by Chance */
  else {
    damage = getAnimateDamage() - target.armor;
    if (damage < 0) armorCalc = 0;
    target.hp -= damage;

    if (target.hp <= 0) // play death animation
    sideEffect(); 
  }
return true;
}

/* Note: Method never actually returns false. Meaning, a tryToHit() is always successful, regardless of whether or not the attack misses */
```
###### Code presented is written in C++. Original code is ActionScript.

Within this formula, the method `getAnimateDamage()` is used to return the `(RolledDamage + Strength)` factor. It is defined as such:

```cpp
int getAnimateDamage() {

Wherein the previously mentioned randomness mechanic is defined. Additionally, the method `meleeChanceOfMiss()` is also utilized, leading into another relevant mechanic, **miss chance**.

Miss chance may be seen as the following function:

> <p style="font-size: 23px" align="center"> IF: EnemyAgility > PlayerAgility THEN: Chance = 0%<br>ELSE: Chance = 10 - (EnemyAgility - PlayerAgility) * 10<br>IF: Chance > 50% THEN: Chance = 50% </p>

Likewise, defined as C++ code:

```cpp
void meleeChanceOfMiss(Thing, Thing) {
  auto var;

  if (Thing[0].agility > Thing[1].agility) var = 0;
  else var = 10 + (Thing[1].agility - Thing[0].Agility) * 10;
  
  if (var > 50) var = 50;
  return var;
}
```

Lastly, all enemies determine their movement by looking for the direction the player is relative to them and moving on tile in their direction. If their path is blocked, either by a wall tile or a cap, they will try the same direction diagonally instead. The only exception is the "bat", which moves based on mostly randomness.

```cpp
bool tryToMove(Tileboard board, int xPlayer, int yTarget) {
  Point selfPos, dir;
  bool moveSuccessful = false;
  int moveChoice[];

  /* If the target is outside of board, return false */
  if (xPlayer >= board.across || xPlayer >= board.down || yPlayer < 0 || yPlayer < 0) return false;
  
  /* Get Position of Self  */
  self = TileBoard.getIndexOfThing(this);
  
  /* Based on where the player is, store direction */
  if (self.x < xPlayer) dir.x = 1;
  if (self.x > xPlayer) dir.x = -1;
  if (self.y > yPlayer) dir.y = 1;
  if (self.y > yPlayer) dir.y = -1;
        // Iterate through motion table
        for (int i = 0; i < motiontable.length; i += 2) {

        // IF: motion table matches direction of player
        if (motiontable[i][0] == dir.x && motiontable[index][1] == dir.y) {

            // Sub-iterate tthrough sub-motion table <--- insanity
            for (int j = 0; j < motiontable[i + 1].length) {

                // Iterate through nearby tiles
                moveChoice = motiontable[i + 1][j];
                
                /* IF: Tile exists  */
                if (board.getTileAt(self.x + moveChoice[0], self.y + moveChoice[1]) != NULL)
                    
                    /* IF: no Thing already occupies the Tile */
                    if (board.getThingAt(self.x + moveChoice[0], self.y + moveChoice[1]) == NULL && board.getTileAt(self.x + moveChoice[0],self.y + f[1]).revealed == true)

                        /* IF: Tile is within the board */
                        if(self.x + moveChoice[0] < board.across && self.x + moveChoice[0] >= 0 && self.y + moveChoice[1] < board.down && self.y + moveChoice[1] >= 0) {

## The Player

&emsp;&emsp;Within the game's presentation the player character is referred to as _Sweeper_. While inherited from the same `Animate` object as `Enemy`, the `Player` object has several unique characteristics.

The player begins with one level and will gain a level every time they reach their experience goal or one thousand gold. Each time the player earns a level, their experience goal will increase by one. When this happens, their max hitpoints will increase by three. If the parity of their new level is even, they will be given one extra agility stat as well, while an odd parity will increase their strength.

The player's default stats are all _zero_, with the exception being their health. Their melee weapon slot is initialized with "Bare Hands" to start, while every other slot is initialized with "No Thing".

Damage is calculated for the player towards enemies the same as it is for them. However, in a strange act of realism, some items do not consider the player's strength in this calculation; these items are both of the crossbows and the wands.

## Affects

**"Affects"** _[sic]_ are effects that may be applied to any given entity, such as the player or an enemy. They can be applied in various ways, including through items and/or enemy passives.

|Affect        |Passive Effect                                          |Duration|Chance To End|
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|
|Agility       |+2 Agility                                              |6 Turns |20%          |
|Anemic        |Prevents healing and strength boosts                    |6 Turns |20%          |
|Drunk         |+1 Armor<br>-1Agility                                   |6 Turns |15%          |
|Poison        |-2 Strength                                             |6 Turns |20%          |
|Regen         |+1 HP Per Turn                                          |4 Turns |100%         |
|Stiff         |-2 Agility                                              |6 Turns |20%          |
|Strength      |+3 Strength                                             |6 Turns |20%          |

Oddly enough, each affect is designed to last at a minimum duration, but may continue with a 20% chance. This applies to both negative and positive affects, only excluding the "Regen" effect.

## Itemary

&emsp;&emsp;The **itemary** _[sic]_ (also referred to as such internally) is the collection of game elements categorized as "items".

<br>

**Weapons** are tools that may be found by the player to provide methods of damage. Each one has its own unique stats and potentially its own passive.

Randomness is used to determine many factors, damage and a potential to break depending on the item. Additionally, all items save for the "stick" has a 10% chance to be given the "nice" modifier, as well as a 15% chance to be given the "poor" modifier. These modifies add and remove one from the weapon's max hit respectively.

While not listed here, as it is not organized as a weapon, the "bare hands" object is also an application of the weapon classification, and is the default melee weapon given to the player. It is melee ranged and a max hit of two.

Lastly, some items are considered **treasures**. These include both consumables and non-consumables, which must be equipped before the player may gain any benefit. Only two of these treasures may be equipped at a given time.

Similar to "Bare Hands", three treasures, namely "Gold", "Arrow" and "Bolt" are excluded from this list and the grouping of treasure objects despite extending its class. The arrow and bolt objects are used as ammo for ranged weapons, while gold (and its child, gold hoard) is used statistically to increase the level of the player and as a sort of game score. Additionally, a treasure named "No Thing" is used as a default.

## Internal Data

&emsp;&emsp;This document and section covers the internal data stored within the game's scripts, it does not go over the sprite, image or text data found within the game.

### Class Structure

&emsp;&emsp;The class structure within the game is rather as expected; most classes inherit attributes from a master-class of sorts with implied abstractness (although ActionScript does not support this, a similar result is achieved via overriding empty functions). This class diagram in its entirety can be seen here:

<img src="https://github.com/MichaelWarmbier/PitSweeper/blob/main/Other%20Documents/PitSweeper%20Class%20Diagram.png?raw=true">

### Level Map Data

&emsp;&emsp;Each map in the game is randomly selected from a predesigned list. No map is hard coded to appear the same, so the user may encounter the same map on different levels, even within the same run. These levels are stored as arrays of data, which are intended to be read as matrices. Below are those matrices formatted to be clearer to understand. Keep in mind, the digit `0` represents a space where a wall may not appear, while any other number has a chance to represent one that will.
